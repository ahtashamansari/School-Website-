	<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us!</h1>
	<p style="width: 80%; margin-left: 100px;" >A school is very genuine place like a temple where we go daily to learn and study to go ahead in our life. We pray to God daily in the school for our better lives and proper study. We say good morning to our class teacher daily and she responses with her smiling face. Our school has a big garden back to the school building. School is the place where we learn everything with the help of our teachers. They help us in working hard for our study and make us tough to go ahead in our life. They tell us about cleanliness, hygiene and proper healthy diet.
</p><p style="width: 80%; margin-left: 100px;">
Our teacher always motivates us to take part in the sports activity, quiz competitions, oral and written activities, debates, scouting, group discussion and other activities in the school. Our class teacher teaches us to maintain discipline of the school and keeps the school compound clean and tidy. Our principal tells us motivational messages daily on the stage of prayer. We learn to be honest, truthful, obedient and sincere in our whole life. We learn how to concentrate on the study in the class room. Our school organizes a quiz competition, dance competition and sports competition annually which is compulsory for us to participate.</p>
